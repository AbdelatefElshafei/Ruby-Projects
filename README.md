# Ruby Projects

Welcome to my **Ruby Projects** repository! This repository contains various projects and scripts written in **Ruby**, showcasing different concepts, algorithms, and practical applications of the language.

## ðŸ“œ Prerequisites

To run the Ruby scripts, ensure you have **Ruby installed** on your machine:

```sh
ruby -v
```

If Ruby is not installed, you can download it from [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).
